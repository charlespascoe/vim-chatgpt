# ChatGPT Plugin for Vim

TODO: Document how to use. In short:

- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your [OpenAI API
  Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Use plugin Manager of your choice to load the plugin
- Build by going into the plugin directory and running `make` (requires Go 1.19)
    - TODO: Download pre-built binaries?
- Use the command `Chat` to start a new chat; type in the bottom of the two
  windows, and then press Enter in normal mode to send your message.
